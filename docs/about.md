For over a decade we've been creating tools and applications for data. We built CKAN, the world's leading data portal platform that powers sites like data.gov and data.gov.uk. We've worked for companies and organizations like Google. We've helped create the open data movement from the ground up.

Our work on the DataHub is the culmination of everything we've done so far, and the distillation of everything we've learnt.

DataHub and its tooling represents our vision for a next generation platform for data management and automation. A platform that transforms your ability to create and use quality data. The result for you or your organization: dramatic improvements in ease, speed and reliability.

Ultimately, we want to revolutionize how we work with data as a community, making it dramatically faster, easier and better to turn data into insight.

And to do we are building a thriving, sustainable business that treats its members, users and community, fairly, transparently and with integrity.
