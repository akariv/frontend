Note that it is very heterogeneous among countries : in the United States \nof America, admin1 represents states, whereas they don't represent the inner countries in the United Kingdom. For more information, please see [official documentation][doc] \nor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_administrative_divisions_by_country.\n\nThe shape of the admin1 have four fields : \n* name : the common name for this admin1 subdivision\n* id : code for the subdivision inside the country. [Documentation][doc] is not clear what this code is, but it could be FIPS. Note that some countries like *Vatican* are so small they don't have inner administrative subdivision. In that case code could be *null* and in any way it is irrelevant.\n* country : name of the country\n* ISO3166-1-Alpha-3 : three letters iso code of the country\n\n[naturalearth]: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/\n[datapackage]: http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\n[doc]: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-1-states-provinces/\n\n## Preparation\n\nTo run the script in order to update the data : see [scripts README](scripts/README.md)\n\n## License\n\nAll data is licensed under the [Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License][pddl]. \n\nNote that the original data from [Natural Earth][naturalearth] is public domain.
